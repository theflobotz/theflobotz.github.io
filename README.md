## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/theflobotz/theflobotz.github.io/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/theflobotz/theflobotz.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.

# FAQ about our Edu email service
These are Newly created and unique (not shared) edu emails.For random named edu emails visit ****NB: For  quick pre-made edu emails with random names visit [https://shoppy.gg/product/xVl4mh8](https://shoppy.gg/product/xVl4mh8)****
we attach the small one time fee because you who genuinely needs the edu for discounts would otherwise not be able to get them if this was a free for all fest as spammers would have already have the emails blocked from online retailers as has happened in the past e.g Spotify requiring SHEERID verification.


a) Are these Edu emails valid with Amazon Student Prime?

We can guarantee you that these emails work flawlessly on Amazon as well as a host of other numerous student discount sites which require just edu e-mail to register. As a matter of fact, 80% of our customers use it for this purpose.However, two day shipping only works for the US.Prime video and music work globally.


b)  Do you recommend that I open a new Amazon Prime account with my .edu address or just add it on to my old account? Even though adding a new email is allowed, we recommend that you just create a new Amazon account.


c) Are there any known sites these emails do not work on?

This Edu email will not work on GitHub, Spotify or any other site that requires Sheer ID verification. If your student discount site is not listed below you can send us a message here so we check for you first :)

d) Can I always access this email? Do I need to change my IP address?

You can access this email just like any other email. No need to change your IP address or use a VPN.


e)  What is the domain of these emails? Which college?
Usnews top 20.

f)  I Want to use this email address for signup to "Google Apps for Education". Can I use this email account for that?

Yeah, sure.

g)  This sounds too good to be true...

Yeah, we all know and have that feeling at times. But you also know there are exceptions to this rule.We are the good guys otherwise we'd not be using PayPal as one of our payment options given both buyer and seller protection.


h)  By any chance, do you do college ID cards?

No we don't.
